As you will see in this lab and the other labs in this course, building a very complex deep learning network can be achieved with Keras with only few lines of code. You will appreciate Keras even more, once you learn how to build deep models using PyTorch and TensorFlow in the other courses.\n",

This additional training data helps the model improve its understanding of the underlying trends, which can lead to better overall performance.  \n"
